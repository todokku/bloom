    title: 'Frequently Asked Questions',
    q1: 'How secure are my data?',
    a1: `Some of your most personal moments are shared on WhatsApp, which is why we built end-to-end encryption.
      We use state of the art cryptography
      (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-xchacha-03" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer">XChaCha20Poly1305</a>,
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer">Argon2id</a>,
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLAKE_(hash_function)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer">Blake2b</a>)
      to securely store your all your data.
      Your data are encrypted on your own devices and (even if we wanted) we can't read them.
      You can learn more about our cryptographic architecture on
      <a href="https://gitlab.com/bloom42/bloom/-/wikis/cryptography" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer">the wiki</a>.<br />
      Also, we do not store financial data ourselves, we use  <a href="https://stripe.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer">Stripe</a>.`,
    q2: 'Where the encrypted data are stored?',
    a2: `The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer">end-to-end</a>
      encrypted data are stored in a  <a href="scaleway.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer">Scaleway</a>
      datacenter in a privacy friendly country: France.`,
    q3: 'Why Bloom is more ethical than other service providers?',
    a3: `Bloom is <b>100% Open Source</b>. Anyone can inspect how Bloom works.
      Also, there are no ads, no affiliate marketing, no creepy tracking.
      Just open technology for a fast, simple, and secure experience.`,
    q4: 'Why do I need to pay to store my data while $BigCompany Drive is (almost) free?',
    a4: `When you don't pay for a service, YOU are the product. <br />
      Your personal data are either shared
      with third party advertisers, or algorithms are applied to your data to sell you more and more products
      you don't need, or even influence elections. <br />
      On the other side, with Bloom, we work for the people who value respect and privacy: You.
      Not investors, not advertisers.`,
    // On the other side, with Bloom, your data are encrypted and are not at the mercy of a
    // tyranic government,
    // a rogue employee, or an over jealous conjoint.`,
    q5: 'I had a very bad experience with $BigCompany customer support, is yours better?',
    a5: `Being an hulan scale company, we do our best to provide a fast and friendly support. <br />
      The people we value are our customers paying us, not the advertisers.`,
    q6: 'Do you issue refunds?',
    a6: `We do not issue refunds, but we offer a free tier
        to allow you to test our applications before subscribing.`,
    q7: 'What happens if I forgot my password and all my devices are signed out?',
    a7: `Due to how encryption works, unfortunately, if you lose your password and all your devices are logged out, you lose all your data. <br />
    If you forget your password but at least one of your devices is signed in, you can normally change your password, without losing nothing. <br />
    We recommend you to note your account's password on a sheet of paper and to hide it somewhere.`,
    q8: 'Why Bloom is an application and not available through web browsers?',
    a8: `In the beginning Bloom was available through web browsers. But after some time we were not satisfied with the poor experience it provided
    and the tradeoffs we had to make. This is why we decided to switch to native applications only. It allows
    offline support, strong encryption, better performance. We want Bloom to be as resilient as possible and the web does not provide
    this feature.`,
