              We think direct communication resolves most issues – if we feel that you are not

              Forums

            <p>
              Certain areas of this platform are public-facing and allow you to interact with others
              (e.g., the Phaser blog and the idea portal) (together, “Forums”).
              These Forums may permit you to submit feedback, information, data, text, software,
              messages,
              or other materials (each, a "Submission"). We love hearing from our users! It's
              incredibly helpful
              and helps us to make a better Phaser for all. If you choose to submit ideas, comments,
              feedback,
              or any other materials either directly to us or via a Forum, you agree that we can use
              them without any
              restrictions or compensation to you. <br /><br />

              You agree that you are solely responsible for all of your Submissions and that any
              such
              Submissions are considered both non-confidential and non-proprietary. If you use
              Forums, you
              also understand that anyone could see your Submissions. Phaser does not endorse,
              nor are we
              required to pre-screen your Submissions (although we might), and, like elsewhere
              on the Internet,
              Submissions from other people could offend you. Further, we do not guarantee that
              you will be able to
              edit or delete any Submission you have submitted.<br /><br />

              By submitting any Submission, you are promising us that you own all rights in your
              Submission,
              your Submission does not infringe on the rights of others, your Submission does not
              violate
              law, and your Submission is not in poor taste.<br /><br />

              You grant to us an irrevocable royalty-free license to copy, modify, publish and
              display your
              Submission, and to make, use and sell (and permit others to use) your Submission
